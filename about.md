### About Me

Hi! My name is Tucker Bohman and I am looking for a career in web development. I have had a passion for technology ever since my dad showed me the power of computers when I was a little boy. Although I studied accounting in school, I missed technology far too much. I recently studied full stack web development at the Flatiron School. During the last six months I gained skills in Ruby, Ruby on Rails, Javascript, JQuery, AngularJS, HTML, and CSS. I built many awesome projects which you can check out on my [Portfolio](/portfolio) page or [git hub account](https://github.com/tuckerbohman5).
