title: My First Blog Post!
---

This is my first blog post on my GitHub Pages website. I will be documenting my learning experiences as I gain the neccessary skills to become a Software Engineer and move back into the tech industry. I am currently an accountant and miss working with technology like i did previously as a Technical Analyst for a software company. I have been trying to teach my self to code for the last few years but have been to busy with my college education but now that I have graduated I decided to take things seriously and learn to code with the help of the Flatiron School in NYC. I am participating in their first cohort of Learn.co a remote learning experience. I love what I have learned so far and can't wait to share my education experience here.
