title: Automated Testing With Selenium WebDriver
---

I am writing this blog post because I wanted to learn more about test automation. Automation is the use of a software tool to run repetable tests against an application. We will be looking at how we can use the Selenium WebDriver to create automated tests but first lets look at why we should automate tests... 

*The main reason we would want to automate tests is to better follow the agile development methodology that most orginizations are now following in one way or another. Note: I will be writing another blog post shortly about the different development methodologies and the basics of each. But automation allows you to run repeatable tests including testing regression. Regression testing helps verify that new changes to the software or application has not broken features that were previously working and tested.
