title: Building My First SPA Using Angular.js
---


This will be the first in a series of blog posts as I build my final project for Learn.co. I am going to SPA(single page application) that allows teachers to keep track of the many books they have in their classroom library. This will be similar to the Sinatra Library I built earlier this year except it will be more adapted for the classroom use by teachers.
